# Data Folder

This folder is intended to store **academic PDF documents** used by the Academic RAG system.

The RAG pipeline indexes and retrieves information from research papers such as:
- NLP and transformer survey papers
- Speech processing and clinical AI research
- Open-access arXiv PDFs

## ⚠️ Important Note

PDF files are **not included** in this repository due to copyright restrictions.

To run the project:
1. Add your own open-access academic PDFs to this folder
2. Ensure the files are text-based (not scanned images)
3. Use clear, descriptive filenames for better traceability

Example:
```
attention_is_all_you_need_2017.pdf
transformers_speech_survey_2025.pdf
clinical_speech_ai_tutorial_2024.pdf
```

This keeps the repository clean while allowing flexible experimentation with different document collections.
